I’m José, a Computer Science Master’s student at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/), Lisbon, specializing in the fields of Software Engineer and Algorithms and Applications with a special interest in Programming Languages and formal software verification.

Right now, I’m working on my Master’s Thesis entitled Automatic Test Generation of Node.js Packages. In its core lies a trace effect type system, that allows the test generator to take into consideration all the relevant parts of the program flow.

In this blog posts I hope to spark some interest in topics that I finds interesting, mostly related to Programming Languages and formal software verification.
